# Pegasus Theme 'Epic Chicuelo'

This Pegasus is greatly inspired by the EmulationStation themes [Chicuelo](https://github.com/chicueloarcade/es-theme-Chicuelo) and [EpicNoir](https://github.com/c64-dev/es-theme-epicnoir). Inspired being a complete understatement since all of the artwork was taken out of those themes.

However, the theme code was mostly written from scratch. After an initial attempt to use the Pegasus theme converter, I decided that a recreation might be a better investment of my time.

# Current State

Currently, this theme is work in progress. However, it has reached a state that allows me to run it on my RPi to select and run games. It doesn't yet fancy things like videos or a more detailed game screen though.
